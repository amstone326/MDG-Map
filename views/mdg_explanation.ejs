	In 2000, the largest gathering of world leaders in history met at United Nations headquarters in 
	New York for the UN Millennium Summit. The result of the summit was the unanimously adopted Millennium 
	Declaration, which includes a short list of ambitious global development goals to be achieved over the 
	next decade and a half. Designated the “Millennium Development Goals”, the MDGs consist of eight specific 
	goals that together address poverty and hunger, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, 
	combating AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability and a global partnership for 
	development. Each of the eight goals is then broken down into one or more specific targets that are easier to 
	measure and quantify.</br></br>
	Philosophically, the MDGs are significant for the statement they make about responsibility 
	for change and improvement. By signing onto the Millennium Declaration, the countries present made it the 
	shared responsibility of all governments of the world to achieve a radically improved standard of living for 
	those living in the world’s developing countries, rather than leaving it to those nations to deal with on 
	their own. Accordingly, work toward the MDGs has encompassed far more than just efforts by the United Nations. 
	Countless initiatives, projects, and pledges have been launched by countless governments, NGOs, and other 
	organizations, all with the goal of working toward some aspect of the MDGs. 
	Since being established in 2000, the MDGs have represented the most ambitious, concrete, and promising 
	unified effort that has ever been made toward eradicating extreme poverty and suffering throughout the 
	developing world. The 8 Millennium Development Goals and their subtargets are:</br></br>
