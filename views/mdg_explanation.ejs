In 2000, the largest gathering of world leaders in history met at United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York for the UN Millennium Summit. The result of the summit was the unanimously adopted Millennium Declaration, which includes a short list of ambitious global development goals to be achieved over the next decade and a half. Designated the “Millennium Development Goals”, the MDGs consist of eight specific goals that together address poverty and hunger, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, combating AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development. Philosophically, the MDGs are significant for the statement they make about responsibility for change and improvement. By signing onto the Millennium Declaration, the countries present made it the shared responsibility of all governments of the world to achieve a radically improved standard of living for those living in the world’s developing countries, rather than leaving it to those nations to deal with on their own. Accordingly, work toward the MDGs has encompassed far more than just efforts by the United Nations. Countless initiatives, projects, and pledges have been launched by countless governments, NGOs, and other organizations, all with the goal of working toward some aspect of the MDGs. This makes accurate and accessible evaluation and presentation of the outcomes of that work all the more essential.
